## Is this the best Recon Script yet?

Definitely not. In fact the code might possibly the worst Python code you'd have seen out in the wild. 


## So why even bother then?

TBH, this was for my own use and I had no intentions of releasing it publicly. I'm just a newbie in this field and trying to enter the game. And Well, the main aim for making this was for me to understand the Recon and Workflow better for myself. While of course, learning Python along the way. I ain't a developer and this is probably the first time I've made coded/scripted something as such. But as I moved along, I've seen a lot of people like me, mainly those starting into bounties and stuff, stumbling upon Recon and Scripting/Coding in general. And thus I decied to make this public, mainly for the beginners like me trying to improve, giving them a *little push* to try and make something like this or just simply use this and focus more on actual pwning. Also as just a little contribution to this amazing community <3


## I have Doubts/Reviews/Suggestions, what to do?

## A Bonus Resource for Beginners

I've also made a small blog at [TheHackrSpace.com](https://thehackrspace.com) where I keep updating about various Infosec and Bug Bounty related stuff, mainly aimed at beginners like me. Do Check that Out! <3


## A Note of Thanks

**This would not have been possible without the contributions of the Awesome people in this community! All the credit goes to the guys making such amazing tools which are used in making this script. Thank You! <3**
